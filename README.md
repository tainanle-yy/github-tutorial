Cumulative Effects Assessment of Watershed Conditions in the Cariboo Region
This project evaluates the cumulative effects on riparian function and vegetation intactness in the Cariboo Region, using a combination of LiDAR data, satellite imagery, and GIS-based spatial analysis. The study focuses on:

Riparian Vegetation Intactness: Comparing vegetation conditions inside vs. outside key land-use areas (e.g., private land, Indian reserves, cutblocks).
Cattle Access Suitability Modeling: Developing a suitability model based on terrain slope and vegetation density.
Canopy Height and Land-Use Comparisons: Assessing differences in canopy height models (CHM) across multiple land categories.
Key Analysis Methods
Spatial data processing using R (sf, terra, lidR)
Statistical comparisons (t-tests, ANOVA)
Interpolation and spatial statistics (Moranâ€™s I, Kriging)
GIS operations (buffering, masking, extraction)
Data Sources
LiDAR-derived Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
Classified LiDAR point clouds for vegetation analysis
Land-use polygons (private land, Indian reserves, cutblocks)
Stream buffer zones
Outputs
CHM-based vegetation distribution maps
Statistical comparisons of riparian function across land-use types
Bar charts and spatial visualizations for CHM distributions
This project is part of a statistics course in Forest Resources Management and aims to contribute to improved watershed and land-use planning.
